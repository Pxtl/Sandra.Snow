Review of abbreviations people use when writing about the leaders on Twitter:

**JT**: Sounds like an 18-year-old played by a 27-year-old in a prime-time soap.

**EOT**: ASCII char 04, End Of Transmission

**YFB**: Which airport is that again?  Oh, right, Iqaluit.

**Singh & Paul**: Short last names means no fun abbrevs.
