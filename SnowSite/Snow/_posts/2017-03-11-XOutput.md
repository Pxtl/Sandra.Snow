[I've released my first version of my fork of XOutput.](https://github.com/Pxtl/XOutput/releases/tag/v0.2.0)  
It's a simple wrapper that allows you to rebind a DInput gamepad as an XInput gamepad.  
Since most games are standardized on XInput (XBox360 controllers), 
this allows you to make an existing gamepad masquerade as an XBox360 controller.
