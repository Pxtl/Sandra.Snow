I'm a luddite with a land-line.

At 7:30PM today (2021-01-26) I was called to participate in the #HamOnt police
town hall.  I was honestly hoping *not* to get called because I'm prone to being
a wishy-washy centrist and I have a lot of online friends that are much further
left I respect the hell out of them, and I feel like I need to fight the good
fight for progressive values.

I half-listened while composing an obnoxiously long question for the mayor so I
would have my thoughts in order when I asked.

Meanwhile questions from the audience started.  I think we got through 5 or 6
overall...

- First question was a nice old man who wanted to compliment how good of a job
  our police are doing instead of asking a question.

- A woman who wanted assurance from the police that they wouldn't taser or shoot
  her troubled family member. -- Police pointed out that they're limited when
  problems include edged weapons and the like, and discussed their partnership
  with mental health professionals and how much that has improved outcomes.

There was a vote-by-phone question where I was asked how I felt the police were
tackling recent crises.  I was thinking about certain newsmaking events, like
how poorly the yellow vest protestors and the Gage park protest went, and gave
an unfavorable response.

- A woman with questions about how the city of Hamilton is tackling the housing
  problems in the city.  Mayor Eisenberger highlighted the extremely high cost
  of providing affordable housing and homeless spaces.   The police highlighted
  their success in getting people into homeless shelters, and said that they
  have enough shelter-space that anybody sleeping rough at this point is because
  they've got problems that preclude them from going to shelters.

I'm definitely missing a few questions.   At some point in this latter block of
questions, I pressed "3" to indicate I had a question.

- The next asker started speaking... I don't remember what they asked.

At 8:07PM, the line abruptly disconnected mid-word.  City of Hamilton abruptly
hung up on me.  **Rude**.

Here's the question I would've asked - I would have written a shorter letter,
but I did not have the time:

> From what I've seen, the Hamilton police budget over the last has grown
substantially over the last 10 years - faster than population growth, faster
than cost-of-living... 
> 
> Hamilton has its problems, but these problems don't seem better or worse than
they were in 2010, so why does policing cost more so much more?  
> 
> I mean Hamilton's biggest crisis right now isn't crime, it's housing.
> 
> Hamilton has a housing problem that's getting worse - council blocks private
market-based homebuilding developments because too tall or too big - see the
Television City building for example.  Affordable or not, even market housing
controls the rising price.  And they're not increasing funding for subsidized
housing to a level that's making any kind of substantial dent in the housing
problem either - so neither markets nor government are fixing this.
> 
> As far as I know, police are the largest line-item outside of city staff budget,
why aren't we seeing the same scrutiny on and line-holding on their budget as we
see on every other part of the city budget?
> 
> I get that Hamiltonians want to support the police, but the same people who
support the police also want Hamilton to deal with the housing crisis that has
now resulted in *literal tent cities*, and hold the line on tax hikes.
> 
> Something's got to give.
