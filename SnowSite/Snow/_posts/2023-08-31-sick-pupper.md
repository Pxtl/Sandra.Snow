So my dog made a mess in his crate overnight.  Not a big deal, he eats anything
he can get his mouth on, upset tummies are expected.  I've parented 3 human
babies, messes happen, I know the drill.

For Waffles, there's no good place in the house to wash him, so normally I take
him out to the driveway and hold him by the collar and clean him off with the
hose.  He doesn't love the cold hose-water, but I've seen him frolick in deep
puddles in January.

And this time I had something new to help!  I fenced in my backyard.  But on the
other hand, the back yard is all grass.  And mud.  And last time I was barefoot,
this time I was wearing flipflops.

I made a strategic mistake.  

Do not underestimate the traction of a panicky Golden in his element.  He ran
*hard* and I skated along my now-muddy lawn in my flipflops, dragged by my
fingers hooked under his collar.  He stopped just in time to bash me against the
shed.

I have newfound respect for rodeo guys that hogtie livestock.

I'm black and blue but the most bruised part of me is my ego for getting
beaten-up by a two-foot-tall 70 lb eunuch.

my poor sick pupper.
