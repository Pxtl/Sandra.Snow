Well, it took longer than I would've liked but I got Github CI working with this
blog! Finally learned how to use Github workflows.

[Workflow files are
here](https://github.com/Pxtl/Sandra.Snow/tree/master/.github/workflows)

<!--excerpt-->

You can now see my posts automatically go from my source-control here in
Sandra.snow into the Pxtl.Github.io repo.  Particularly interesting is that
because the Sandra.Snow project I'm using for the blog is .NET Framework 4, the
runner is actually running *windows*.  I didn't know that was possible for
GitHub.

[For example, here's a log of a publish
action](https://github.com/Pxtl/Sandra.Snow/actions/runs/6909229230/job/18800147451#logs)

The only thing that annoys me is that I had to set it up using PATs, which have
a 90 day expiry.  So every 90 days I'll have to refresh the token that allows
the Sandra.Snow repo to write to the Pxtl repo?  That seems labourious.

Probably I should reverse it around - have the Action running in my Pxtl repo so
it's *pulling* from the Sandra.Snow repo.  But for now, this works.

This post is my first attempt to run it for a new post.  Fingers crossed!

Edit: it works!
