#York Boulevard Centre-Aligned Bike lanes

Since everyone else has thrown a design out there for saving the York bike track since it's being kicked off the westbound side of York, I thought I'd do the same.  
There are a handful of cities that have implemented centre-aligned bike lanes.  There are some advantages to this flow: Drivers expect to see oncoming traffic on the left.  In one-way traffic like Cannon, this means putting the cycle track on the left (relative to the 1-way car lanes).  In a two-way street, this means using the centre - it's on the left for both directions of traffic.  This allows us to put a bidirectional cycle track, protected, in one place, without having oncoming traffic on the right.

Also, a feature very particular to York and Cannon, Cannon merges with York Boulevard at Queen to form a single road.  The Cannon lanes, if continued, would end in the centre of this road.  So let's see what that looks like - the Cannon lanes continue righ to Queen, and only have to deal with left-turning traffic turning across the bike lane.

No need to cross York or Cannon for straight-through drivers.  Since the left-turn signals are already in a separate phase, that means *no* unexpected interactions between the bike lane and drivers for straight-through riding.  Of course, a "yield to bikes" sign is needed for the uncontrolled left-turn at the U-Turn slip road.

This isn't some zany invention.  Other cities have noticed the obvious advantage of a bike track in the middle of a bi-directional road - all the cyclists are in one place, and oncoming traffic is on the left, where two side-aligned bike lanes (one in each direction) creates conflicts with parking, and a bi-directional cycle track on the side of the road means oncoming traffic in a very unexpected place.  Of course, there are **drawbacks** too - it makes turning for cyclists much more difficult.  Every turn requires a bike box.  And it only works if drivers can only go left at an explicit left-turn-signal, or else left-turns are going across a bike lane, which in the case of York could be very unexpected since the "left hook" zone would be very hard for a westbound driver to see.

## Other cities with centre-aligned bike lanes

The most notable street with a centre aligned cycle track is easily one of the most notable streets in the world: Pennsylvania Avenue.  The street with the White House on it.

Look at that jerk blocking the bike lane with his big limo.

Because of the need for parads on Pennsylvania, they can't put proper protections on ther bike lane.  York Boulevard is a lot of things, but not a parade route.  So we don't have that limitation.

Looking closer, most of the intersections on Pennsylvania advise turning cyclists just to cross in crosswalks - topologically this is practically identical to a bike box, but lets the city focus on their nice, presentable cocrete crossings.  Where no concrete exists, a slightly-unorthodox bike box is present.

Another city with centre bike lanes is NYC.  Brooklyn sports centre-aligned bikeways on Sands St, leading to the bikeway on the Manhattan Bridge.  The ability to protect these centre bikeways shines here.  Again we see some mixed use of bike boxes for turning movements.
