title: More rigid
---
If you watch "Well There's Your Problem" podcast (about engineering disasters),
Alice has an iconoclastic opinion on things like expansion plates and swivel
joints and the general flexibility of good engineering: "No, make it more
rigid!" I have taken that to heart with some recent home improvement projects.
