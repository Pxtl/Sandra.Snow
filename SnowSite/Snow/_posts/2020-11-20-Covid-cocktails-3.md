After a break, I'm back with a 3rd round of Covid cocktails.  First off, I
finished off the sweet vermouth and bought some proper Dolin. 

Also, Collective Arts gin is pretty expensive as London dry gins go, but I
bought myself a bottle as a treat... and then my wife bought me another bottle
as a birthday present.  So I have a lot of gin to use.

# Covid Cocktails, Round 3

## Day 1

The **New York Sour**, which is a Chicago invention and was maybe named as an
insult because it's so fancy-looking.

- 2 oz rye 
- 1 oz (half a lemon) fresh lemon 
- 1 oz 1:1 simple syrup  

Shake w ice, strain to glass  

Then float 

- 1 oz red wine over bar spoon on top.

![New York Sour](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/New-York-sour.jpg)

Definitely a nice drink.  The wine hits your nose first and it's wine-forward,
before switching over to the lemonade and whiskey flavors.  I used a wine that
was *way* too good for this drink because it's what we were drinking the night
before, but any fruity red should do. Good thing to make if you've already got a
bottle open.

## Day 2

I figured I should get at least one Italian amaro, and patriotism made me pick
Fernet Branca because it's big in Argentina.

Fernet is commonly drunk as a short shot digestif - like an after-dinner mint,
so before mixing with it I thought I'd give it a try straight.

...

It tastes like dentist's polishing paste, but without sweetener. I'm
not kidding, it's *powerful*. Concentrated mint and herb and no sugar to help it
go down.

So, in Argentina the standard club drink is **Fernet con Coca**, which is Fernet
Branca and coke.

- 1.5 oz fernet
- half a can of Coke (I'm using Coke Zero)
- Ice

![Fernet con Coca](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/Fernet-con-Coca.jpg)

... best thing I can say about this foamy minty Coke is that it grows on you.
Reminds me of how much Argentinos smoke.

Seriously, Fernet tastes like liquefied menthols.  It is *bracing*.  Like it's
the perfect digestif if dinner was a half-pack of cigarettes.  Reading about how
they like to mix it 1:1 with coke, I can't even imagine.

It's not without its appeal, but damn.

## Day 3

A nice normal **gin martini**.  I attempted this one because I wanted to get the
seminal classic right... my first attempt, I half-assed and it was bad. 

3:1 ratio of Collective Arts gin and dry vermouth, and an olive.

Okay, Dolin dry vermouth is great stuff - fruity and just a little sweet, and
mixes nicely with the subtle Collective Arts gin... but I'll do a 5:1 next time.

![Tiny gin martini](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/martini-mini.jpg)

I put it into one of my tiny stemless glasses because I wanted a small one and
it looked ridiculous in my huge cocktail glasses. I love savory drinks though,
and I don't see what the olive adds *at all*, albeit I used the wrong kind
(Kalamata instead of a stuffed queen). At the very least I need proper garnish
skewers.

### Addendum

I tried this again later, and it went much better.

In honor of... wait, no, he was an unrepentant wifebeater.  To mark the passing
of Sir Sean Connery: a dry martini.

- 2.5 oz London dry gin
- 0.5 oz vermouth
- 2 dashes of orange bitters
- olives

Stirred, because do I look like I give a damn?

![Proper gin martini](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/martini.jpg)

Definitely better in a 5:1 ratio, and the saltiness of the queen olives aren't a
bad mix in this format.  Collective Arts gin is more a of a subtle flavor and
that might not match this perfectly, but it was very nice.  The olives add a
nice nose too.

## Day 4

**Irish Coffee** (or rather, Canadian coffee, since I'm using Canadian whiskey
and maple syrup)

- 1 oz Canadian whiskey
- 1 oz simple syrup
- a half-cup of coffee

Add whiskey, syrup, coffee to cup.

- 1/4-cup of whipping cream in a measuring cup, blended with an immersion mixer
  & a little maple syrup.  
  
Dump the whipped cream on top, and grate some nutmeg.

![Irish coffee](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/Irish-coffee.jpg)

This is very, very tasty, but I put too much nutmeg.  But on the plus side, my
first time whipping cream with an immersion mixer and it's surprisingly easy to
do unless you drop the immersion mixer on the floor like an idiot and spend the
next hour fixing it.  I don't recommend that step.

## Day 5

The **Midnight Stinger**.  The Fernet makes its big return.

- 1 oz whiskey
- 1 oz Fernet Branca
- 3/4 oz lemon juice
- 3/4 oz sugar syrup (mine is 1:1)

Shake with ice, pour into a glass full of crushed ice.

![Midnight Stinger](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/midnight-stinger.jpg)

... okay, this tasted too harsh at first, but it grew on me as the ice melted
and softened it.  I get a lot of sore throats because of allergies and asthma,
so I'm a bit of a connoisseur of lozenges.  This is a pretty darned good Ricola
slushie.

In hindsight I shouldn't have used the blender for ice, it was too fine - a bag
and some smashing might've produced something a little less slushie-esque.  But
yeah, it really tasted like Ricola.

## Day 6

We go back to sours for a minute for a nice twist on a vodka sour: the **Bernice**

- 2 oz vodka
- 3/4 oz lime
- 1/2 oz galliano
- 1/2 oz simple syrup

Shaken with ice, pour to a chilled cocktail glass.

![Bernice](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/Bernice.jpg)

Nice, tangy sour with a vanilla twist.  Don't overthink it, it's good.

[Hat-tip, Difford's Guide](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/2901/bernice)

**Note:** I'm an idiot.  It took me how long to suddenly notice the obvious - I
have Galliano Vanilla, not Galliano L'Autentico.  The LCBO doesn't even sell
Galliano L'Autentico.  All this time... I'm using the simple vanilla one, not
the proper complex one.

Everything I'm doing is wrong.  I want you to know this.

## Day 7

Named after a British bar in Rangoon, the **Pegu Club** cocktail is a nice glass
of colonialism.

- 2 oz gin
- 0.75 oz curacao
- 0.5 oz lime
- dash orange bitters
- dash angostura bitters

Shake with ice, pour to a chilled glass, garnish with a lime wheel.

![Pegu Club](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/Pegu-club.jpg)

Comes out complex and fruity but very dry and boozy.  I probably put too much
lime.  It grew on me as I got further down the glass, but overall I probably
won't mix this again.  Collective Arts gin probably isn't a good fit for this
either - a more mix-y gin would go better.

## Day 8

Covid cocktails 3, day 8: the **Patriota**, an iced espresso drink.

- 1.5 oz Moka pot espresso
- 2 barspoons fine sugar mixed in the shot glass with the coffee
- 0.5 oz 360 double chocolate vodka
- 0.5 oz fernet branca
- 2 oz white Cuban rum

Shake with ice, strain to chilled glass.

I've scaled up the recipe a bit, and am using a Moka pot instead of true
espresso and double chocolate vodka instead of creme de cacao.  Also when I
first read the recipe I thought it was a hot drink, hence the goblets. Would've
been fine in a cocktail glass.

![Patriota](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/patriota.jpg)

... 

I loved this one.  It's rich and sweet.  Minty dark chocolate and coffee, with a
little bit of natural foam on top.

This time the double chocolate substitution wasn't overpowering as the strong
Fernet and coffee flavours stand up to it.

This completely eclipses the espresso martini for me.

## Day 9

Toronto.  Yes, that's the name of the drink, **Toronto**.  I mixed
it in the glass, on the rocks.

- 1.75 oz whiskey
- 0.25 oz fernet branca
- 0.25 oz syrup
- 1 dash Angostura bitters
- ice

Basically an old fashioned with a little Fernet.

![Toronto](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/Toronto.jpg)

...

And yeah, it tastes like an old fashioned with some Fernet... which isn't a bad
idea, really.  The hit of mint was very nice.  I've switched to regular Crown
Royal Deluxe for drinks like this - solid caramel & rye flavors without
overpowering the rest.  CR deluxe isn't great on its own but for mixing I like
it - some mixing whiskeys disappear into the drink, and by contrast the Crown
Royal Harvest Rye (which I love straight) overwhelms mixed drinks with its
bitterness.

So, apparently I liked Toronto.

## Day 10

The **Yellow Bird** (one of many drinks by that name apparently, I forget where
I found this specific instance of the recipe).  Similar to Bernice in that it's
a sour with Galliano, but some big differences:

- 1 oz white Cuban rum
- 0.5 oz lime
- 0.5 oz triple sec
- 0.5 oz Galliano

Shaken with ice, strain to chilled cocktail glass.

![Yellow Bird](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/yellow-bird.jpg)

A nice easy drink. Like a mashup of a daiquiri and a Harvey Wallbanger.
Creamsicle and lime.

## Day 11

El Presidente, an old Cuban cocktail from pre-revolution days.

- 1.5 oz white rum
- 0.75 oz triple sec
- 0.75 dry vermouth
- 0.5 oz grenadine

Did some slight modifications - more grenadine (proper recipes call for a few
barspoons instead of a half-ounce), and it's not blanc (semi-sweet) vermouth.

![El Presidente](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/el-presidente.jpg)

...

Nice.  Boozy, fruity, and sweet.  The vermouth and the grenadine and the triple
sec are like a little fruit salad.  I'm a little off-book on this but I think
it's close-enough since the extra sweetness from the extra grenadine counteracts
the tartness of the dry vermouth.

Enjoyed this one enough that I made a pair of them for my wife and I to mark the
US election night.

## Day 12

Covid Cocktails 3: Day 12. Named for the three-fingered Romani jazz guitarist,
the **Django Reinhardt**.

- 3 oz dry vermouth
- 0.5 oz simple syrup (I'd switched to 2:1 ratio at this point, use 0.75 for 1:1)
- 0.75 oz fresh lemon juice
- 2 slices of orange (I used 3 slices clementine)

Combine in shaker, muddle the orange (well, clementine, whatever), then add ice
and shake, strain to a rocks glass with ice in it. Garnish with an orange slice.

...

![Django Reinhardt](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/Django-Reinhardt.jpg)

It's pretty tasty - a tangy vermouth mimosa.  No big surprises, just a nice
orangey drink.  Surprisingly straightforward for such an elaborate name.

Cleaning the orange bits out of the shaker sucked, though.  I'll just use a
normal press instead of muddling next time.

## Day 13

A nice **hot toddy**.

- 2 oz whiskey
- 2 tsp brown sugar
- 2 dashes angostura bitters
- 4 oz hot water
- lemon twist

Just mix in a mug.

![Hot Toddy](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/hot-toddy.jpg)

Yeah. A nice hot drink for a cold day for your whiskey of choice.  The
bakery-spice notes of the whiskey and bitters are very nice served hot.  I think
this is going to be my "pumpkin spice latte" for the winter.

I'm using a "How To Drink" recipe that is technically a "whiskey skin" but
whatever.  

Also, because this is a hot drink I'm using brown sugar instead of his demerara
syrup, because it's handy and it's going to dissolve anyways.

## Day 14

Wifey bought me a beautiful metal mug for my birthday so I'm doing the Moscow
Mule for my finale.

- 2 oz vodka
- 1 oz lime
- 6(ish) oz ginger beer

Build in the traditional copper-plated Moscow Mule mug, stir with ice, garnish
with lime wheel.

![Moscow Mule](/images/2020-11-20-Covid-cocktails-3/Moscow-mule.jpg)

Tasty, but too much lime.  I'd cut that back to 3/4 ounce.  And strong
Jamaican ginger beer is definitely an acquired taste - "mule" describes the
noise my kid made when I gave her some leftover ginger beer.

The best part of this drink is the mug, honestly.  The cold flows right out of it into your hands and
the condensation just goes *everywhere*.  It's refreshing just to hold it.  I'm
going to be using the heck out of this in summer.

# Final Thoughts

I've been having a good time exploring new flavors here.  I'm happy I had good
uses for the gut-punch powerful flavor of the Fernet Branca, especially.  Also,
Dolin vermouth is so nice I've been having it straight once in a while as a
night-cap.  And the Collective Arts artisan gin is wonderful (albeit expensive).
It's probably to mix it like I have, the gin tastes wonderful straight after a
good chill in the freezer.

There were a lot of good hits in this round.  Stand-out favorite was the
**Patriota**, but I definitely enjoyed the **gin martini**, **el presidente**,
and the **hot toddy**, and have made all of them more than once since first
trying them.  And the sheer balls-out weirdness of the **midnight stinger**
won't be anybody's favorite but it was a memorable fun drink.  Maybe when summer
comes around I'll put that into the copper cup.

In the meantime until coming back to exploring new cocktails again, I finally
got my home gym set up.  Holy crap I'm out of shape.
